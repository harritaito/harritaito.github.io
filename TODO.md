# Package Upgrade To-Do

This repository contains a Next.js site. Package upgrades were attempted but failed due to network restrictions. Once network access is available, complete the steps below.

- [ ] Allow `npm` to access the registry so `npm outdated` and `npm update` can run.
- [ ] Run `npm outdated` to see which dependencies require updates.
- [ ] Update packages via `npm update` or by editing `package.json`.
- [ ] After upgrading, install `jest-environment-jsdom` so Jest can run tests.
- [ ] Execute `npm test` to verify tests pass.
- [ ] Build and export the site using `npm run build` and `npm run export`.
- [ ] Update documentation if any breaking changes occur.
