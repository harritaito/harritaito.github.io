# TODO.md — Automated Upgrade Plan for **harritaito.github.io**

> **Status 2026-07-02:** Sections 1–4 and 6–9 are complete on `master`
> (Jest 30, React 18.3, Next 15, styled-jsx 5.1.7, peripherals at target
> versions, lockfile deduped). Section 5 (React 19) is the only upgrade
> still open. Section 10 collects redesign notes; note that its
> "simple contact method" must-have is currently covered by the LinkedIn
> CTA and the email hint on /about.
> **Protocol for Codex**
> 1. Read the *PROMPT* block in the current section.  
> 2. Output **one unified diff** that satisfies the *CONSTRAINTS*.  
> 3. Output **one Conventional Commit** line (`type(scope): subject`).  
> 4. **Stop**. (No explanations.)  
> 5. Proceed to the next section only after CI (unit tests + ESLint + Playwright + Percy) passes.

## 0 · safety-net 🛡️
Human-only step; Codex does **not** execute.
- Freeze `package-lock.json` (`git tag v2025-07-pre-upgrade`).
- Ensure Playwright smoke tests and Percy are green.
