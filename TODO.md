# TODO.md — Automated Upgrade Plan for **harritaito.github.io**

> **Status 2026-07-22:** Sections 0–4 and 6–9 are complete on `master`
> and kept below as a historical record only — do not re-run them.
> Current stack: React 18.3.1, Next 15.5, Jest 30, ESLint 9,
> styled-jsx 5.1.7, peripherals at target versions, lockfile deduped.
> Section 5 (React 19) is the only upgrade still open.
> Section 10 collects redesign notes; note that its
> "simple contact method" must-have is currently covered by the LinkedIn
> CTA and the email hint on /about.
> **Protocol for Codex**
> 1. Read the *PROMPT* block in the current section.  
> 2. Output **one unified diff** that satisfies the *CONSTRAINTS*.  
> 3. Output **one Conventional Commit** line (`type(scope): subject`).  
> 4. **Stop**. (No explanations.)  
> 5. Proceed to the next section only after CI (unit tests + ESLint) passes.
