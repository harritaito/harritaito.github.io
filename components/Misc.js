                <p>In Fall and Winter 2014-2015 I took part in an innovation project as UX designer.</p>
                <p>In a five person multicultural team we designed a new customer oriented insurance claim-notification concept to big Finnish insurance company called OP Insurance.</p>
                <p>During the project I gained experience on project based group work, brainstorming, user-centered design and conceptualizing. I was responsible and created personas, mock-ups and fine-honed UI designs to mobile & desktop platforms.</p>
                <p>I can happily say that my work is under NDA as they purchaced our concept from us.</p>
