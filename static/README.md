# STATIC

This directory contains your static files.
Each file inside this directory is mapped to /. For example, `/static/robots.txt` will be served as `/robots.txt`.

More information about static file serving in Next.js can be found in the documentation:

**This directory is not required; you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**
