# AGENTS.md
These instructions apply to the contents of the `docs` directory.
- Maintain Markdown files using ATX-style headings (e.g. `#`, `##`).
- Keep lines wrapped at 100 characters or fewer to ease reviews.
- Use relative links for intra-repo references.
- Prefer descriptive link text instead of bare URLs.
- Run `npm test` and `npm run build` after documentation updates when practical.
